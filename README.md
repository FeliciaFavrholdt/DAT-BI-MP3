# IBM HR Attrition Prediction Project

### Created by Group 4 - Alberte & Felicia

#### We have used pair programming to create this project so Felicia has been the one coding and writing. 

## Objective 
The objective of this mini project is to provide practice in data analysis and prediction by regression,
classification and clustering algorithms.

## Problem Statement
Attrition is the rate at which employees leave their job. When attrition reaches high levels, it becomes
a concern for the company. Therefore, it is important to find out why employees leave, which factors
contribute to such significant decision.

## Dataset
This project is done by exploration analysis and use of machine learning
from the synthetic data provided by IBM to Kaggle: 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data.

## Tasks
1. Data wrangling and exploration
2. Linear regression (Monthly Income)
3. Classification (Attrition)
4. Clustering (Employee Segmentation)
5. Streamlit Web App

## Tehnologies
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit

- How accurate is your solution of prediction? Explain the meaning of the quality measures.

- Which are the most decisive factors for quitting a job? Why do people quit their job?

- What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy of the models?

- Which work positions and departments are in higher risk of losing employees?

- Are employees of different gender paid equally in all departments?

- Do the family status and the distance from work influence the work-life balance?

- Does education make people happy (satisfied from the work)?

- Which were the challenges in the project development?
